fix(shell): all shellcheck issues (except quotes)

PR body:
Resolved the following shellcheck warnings and errors:

- SC2029: Note that client-side expansion happens (disabled where intentional)
- SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
- SC2162: read without -r will mangle backslashes
- SC2001: See if you can use ${variable//search/replace} instead of sed
- SC2004: $/${} is unnecessary on arithmetic 
...
r is antiquated. Consider rewriting this with $((..))
