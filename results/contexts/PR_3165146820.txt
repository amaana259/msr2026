## Summary

This PR addresses the user's concerns about missing documentation and build artifacts in the `@openagentsinc/nostr` package.

## Changes

### 🧹 Cleanup
- Removed all build artifacts (`.js`, `.js.map` files) from the `src` directory
- These files were mistakenly generated in the source directory and have been cleaned up

### 📚 Documentation

#### Updated README.md
- Comprehensive overview of the package architecture
- Detailed usage examples for all 10 implemented NIPs
- Code examples
...

- **Clean Codebase**: Removing build artifacts prevents confusion and keeps the source clean
- **Transparency**: IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md shows exactly what's done and what remains
- **Maintainability**: Developer guide ensures consistent patterns for future contributions

## Testing

All existing tests pass (except for the known flaky relay pool test which is unrelated to these changes).
