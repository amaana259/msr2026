PR title:
Fix: Preserve empty string config values in StripConfig

PR body:
## Summary

This PR fixes an issue where instance config fields with empty string values were vanishing after apply, causing "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply" errors.

## Problem

When users set config fields like `cloud-init.network-config`, `cloud-init.vendor-data`, or `user.user-data` to empty strings in their Terraform configuration:

```hcl
config = {
  "cloud-init.network-config" = ""
  "cloud-init.vendor-data"    = ""
  "user.user-data"            = ""
}
```

These field
...
empty strings when needed

## Testing

- Added unit test `TestStripConfig_PreservesEmptyStrings` to verify the fix
- Test confirms that empty string values from user config are preserved
- Test also verifies that computed keys and null values behave correctly

## Related Issues

This type of issue commonly affects cloud-init and user-data fields where empty strings may be valid configurations.

fix: preserve empty string config values in StripConfig

The StripConfig function was not preserving empty string values from
user configuration, causing fields like cloud-init.network-config,
cloud-init.vendor-data, and user.user-data to vanish after apply
when set to empty strings.

This fix ensures that empty string values explicitly set by users
are preserved in the Terraform state, preventing "inconsistent result
after apply" errors.
