PR body:
Hey Alariq, 

We haven't discussed using AI-assisted coding so I'm not sure if you're cool with me submitting changes that I've worked on with claude's help. If not just reject this PR and let me know in the comment.

I'm opening this PR to implement additional documentation & automation in getting this set up for windows contributors. With this someone is able to immediately get up and running by running the 2 batch files that extract the 3rdparty.zip and configure cmakelists properly. 

The result is 2 clicks and anyone is able to immediately work on and contribute from windows.

More details:

- Clarify that 3rdparty/ is temporary and extracted from 3rdparty.zip
- Update build steps to show extraction process
- Add note about not committing 3rdparty folder to git
- Ensure clean repository state while maintaining build convenience

feat(ui): add resolution-aware scaling to main menu layout

Implemented dynamic scaling logic in MainMenu::render() to make the main menu UI adapt to various screen resolutions. 
Scaling factors are now calculated based on a 1024x768 baseline, with optional caps for layout and font scaling. 
This improves usability at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K without breaking existing layout behavior.
Fix main menu copyright text scaling and alignment

- Manually center and scale copyright text based on resoluti
