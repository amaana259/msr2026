PR title:
fix: Remove SDK import causing module resolution error on agents page

PR body:
## Summary
Fixes critical module resolution error on /agents page that was causing complete page failure.

## Bug Details (Fixes #1029)
- Removed unused `@openagentsinc/sdk` import from `agent-chat.ts` line 26
- Browser cannot resolve npm module specifiers without bundling
- This was causing: `Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "@openagentsinc/sdk"`

## Impact
- The agents page was completely broken
- Users saw blank page with console errors
- Agent chat functionality didn't work

## Solution
Removed the unused SDK import since it wasn't being used in the component.

## Test Plan
- [x] Verified agent-chat.ts no longer imports SDK
- [x] Built openagents.com successfully
- [ ] Manually test /agents page loads without console errors
