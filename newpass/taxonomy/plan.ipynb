    "##### (1) **Define what a failed PR means.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A failed PR is a PR that was closed and not merged. A stale-failed PR can also be a PR that has remained open with greater than 90 days of activity (optional for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (2) **Translate Wang et.al's categories onto our approach.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Wang et.al's paper deals with abandonment of code changes, particularly on Gerrit, which is a popular review tool. There, they have enough contextual information to classify the reason for abandonment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our case is similar but differentiates in two clear ways. Firstly, we deal with GitHub PRs and secondly, we are dealing with failed/rejected PRs and not necessarily 'abandoned' PRs. Nevertheless, we aim to define a similar taxonomy inspired by Wang et.al.\n",
